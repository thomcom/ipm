# Idle Planet Miner New Player Guide

Welcome to Idle Planet Miner (IPM)!
This game is more than you expected.
If you have experience with MMOs or MBAs,
you will recognize the structure of this game.
It is a skill-tree maximization meta game.
You can play it fast, and you can play it slow.
Some times you have to play it slow.
Some times you have to play it fast.
The top players have been playing for many years.
They don't remember how to play the beginning
"levels", but using their wisdom and my early
experience, you won't have to guess.

Warning: Spoilers ahead. Idle Planet Miner is
about learning the optimal growth of a skill-tree
through repetition. If you follow this guide,
you won't have to "play" through your first
20-30 Galactic Sales, you'll just know what to do.

All of this information and so much more is available
at the IPM discord. You can get an invite from the
game settings page, check it out!

The first section describes the basics of Idle
Planet Manager. Skip ahead to the second section,
beginner walkthrough, if you want instructions on
an optimized approach to mining the first 20 planets.

# Section 1: What is Idle Planet Miner

# Selling Your Galaxy
"Rebooting" starts you over from day 1, but you
keep managers, stars, credits, DM, rover
missions, and beacon points. Your game will run
faster after each reboot, sometimes much faster
and sometimes not.

# Dark Matter (DM)
Used for purchasing Brilliant Academy Managers and
Slots for them.

# Ships
All for-purchase ships will speed up gameplay only.
They are all essential.

# Galaxy Value (GV)
In your settings click "Show Galaxy Value". Your
GV, plus the Exodus Ship, plus your Lounge
Mothership room, determines the number of credits
you get when you reboot.

# Credits
Credits are used over many reboots. They purchase
and upgrade Mothership Rooms, which are the main
way of progressing through the game's timeline.

# Managers
Each manager has a primary boost, a secondary boost,
and a level. You must purchase Slots for your
managers using DM. Each Slot allows you to assign
a manager to a planet. You must also purchase
managers using DM. Only purchase 500 DM managers
from Briliant Academy. You will receive one
Ark Public School manager per week for free
as a daily reward.

A manager can be promoted to the next level by
combining three other managers of the same level
into it. The other three managers are lost.
Managers with three stars and above have a
secondary boost.

There are three primary boosts: Mining rate, ship
speed, and cargo. Assign a mining rate manager to
a planet to increase the production of ore on that
planet. Assign a speed or cargo manager to a planet
to get extra ore off of the planet if it has
accumulated.

There are five secondary boosts: All mining rate,
all ship speed, all cargo, craft speed, and smelt
speed. Every secondary boost is good. Smelt and
craft are the best, but won't contribute to your
game until you have many slots.

In general, four managers of a specific level are
better than one manager of one-level-higher. Only
promote managers if you have more managers than
you have slots. Don't have more slots than you
have managers.

The best manager is mine/mine. Maximizing mining
output is the fundamental objective of IPM.

# Stars

When you complete challenges, tournaments, and
some rover missions you receive stars. Each star
is randomly assigned to one ore, alloy, or item,
and increases its value by 20%. You do not control
stars in any way, but as you accumulate them
your game speed increases.

Credits + Managers + Stars = Your Level

# Mothership Rooms

There are many mothership rooms that will not be
discussed in detail in this guide. Read about them
[here](https://idle-planet-miner.fandom.com/wiki/Rooms)
Credits are used to purchase mothership rooms. All
mothership rooms are valuable, and you should purchase
new ones as the price of upgrading the ones you have
increases. The most important early-game mothership
rooms are Engineering and Lounge. As your mothership
room levels increase, your game progress will increase.

# Planets

Planets produce ore. They must be unlocked as projects,
then purchased using $. The first 20 planets will be
discussed in reasonable detail in
[Section 2](# Section 2: First 20 planets Walkthrough)

# Ore

Each level of planets provides one or more new ore types.
Each ore is worth double the previous ore. Planet basic
upgrade costs increase with the cost of the ores that
they produce, but usually your highest planets and highest
ores will produce, by far, the most $.

The more individual ores per second that your galaxy
produces, the larger your asteroid and debris awards will
be.

You will occasionally tap on your mothership to sell
ore for $ which you will use to upgrade your planets.
Move the sell slider to about 90% and sell your ore
once or twice. Always leave 3k+ ore of all types for
your Smelter to use.

[TODO img of slider]

Ore can be set to auto-sell in the Mothership screen.
Only do this until you have purchased the first four
planets or have enough Copper and Iron income to
complete the first two projects.

# Smelting

Ore is converted to Alloy via Smelting. The third
project you will unlock is Smelting, which enables this.
In [Section 2](# Section 2: First 20 planets Walkthrough)
you will read about the order of smelting to perform
to quickly progress through the early planets.

# Alloy

Every ore can be combined in various numbers to create an
Alloy. The alloy is typically worth 2x the value of the
ores that were used to produce it.

There are only three circumstances when you should sell
Alloys. The first is when you receive a large asteroid
bonus. Don't sell all of them, but always leave at least
500+ to use in future crafting projects. The second time
is in your first few Galaxies, if you have been idle for
a long time, and have many more of an alloy than you will
likely use. You can recycle these Alloys for $ to use to
upgrade your planets. The last circumstance is if an
Alloy has a very good Market and you are able to produce
many of them to sell before the Market expires.  Do not
ever sell Alloy outside of these rules: the time it takes
to produce it is always more valuable than the $.

# Crafting

Alloy combines with Items to produce other items in
the Crafting panel. The earliest items only require
Alloy to produce, and later items require a combination
of Alloy and Items, or only other Items.

Crafting requires the most substantial portion of time
in IPM. In the beginning, your games will be long
because you will always be waiting for your Crafter
to finish.

In [Section 2](# Section 2: First 20 planets Walkthrough)
I will provide build orders for Alloys and Items that
will progress you through the Items that are required
to complete all projects up to Planet 20 and a little
beyond.

# Items

Items are simply another level of Alloy. They are used
primarily for completing projects to upgrade your Galaxy
or gain new abilities. A detailed discussion of Items
that you need to progress in the early levels is in
[Section 2](# Section 2: First 20 planets Walkthrough).
The only time you should sell Items is if you have very
good market for a specific item and can produce many of
them. Otherwise they should be saved for projects.

# Asteroid Miner

The first project you will unlock is Asteroid Miner. This
causes an asteroid to appear every 6 minutes. Tapping the
asteroid, you will find an amount of a random Ore or Alloy
that you have unlocked. This can make your Galaxy, as a
large amount of a specific Alloy can save you much Smelting.

# Ark Bonus

On the same time frame, a yellow play button will appear
every six minutes. The ark has a 50% chance of giving you
5 DM or a cash bonus. The ark gives you the greater of
4.75% cash on hand or 2.295% of GV.  The crossover 
happens when your cash-on-hand is about 48% of your GV.

Continuously Arking will increase your GV by 27% per hour,
ignoring all other inputs. This is the fastest way to
advance.

At this point I will note that your Galaxy produces ore
at a much slower rate when IPM is not in the foreground
of your device. Estimates say that your Ore/$ production
is only 22% in the background than in the foreground.
Crafting and Smelting occur at full speed, but mining does
not. IPM intends for you to leave it running all the time.

# Debris Scanner

Debris harvesting is identical to Asteroid Miner, except
that it produces Items instead of Ores and Alloys. The
Debris Scanner project is pretty expensive and is a
mid-game development and will not be covered in this guide.
I have 38 reboots and have never come close to it.

# Rover

Rover produces DM, Stars, and Boosts.

# Boosts

Boosts are DM-purchasable items that speed up your game.
In general, you don't need to save them. Use them during
any long-run to get you farther than you've been before.

## Boost Stacking

The most important feature of Boosts is that Planet Boost
and Production Boost stack with Time Warp. Use a Time Warp
while Planet Boost or Production Boost is active to
receive the Boost benefit for an entire hour in the
background.

# Market

Market changes randomly and can slightly modify your progress.
Later game projects make the Market slightly more predictable.
In the early game, you can build Alloys or Items that have
a high market value and experience consierable time savings.

Similarly, a poor market can slow you down.

# Colonization

Colonization appears as an option very early in your project
development. Using Colonization in the early game is a very
bad idea.

Colonization allows you to massively increase the production
of the lowest level planets. Don't spend anything on Colonization
until you have completed the following walkthrough. Colonization
tasks are useful to increase your overall mine rate, which improves
pink asteroid value, but they are very expensive in all of the
minor items that you will need to get to planet 20.
