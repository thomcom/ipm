# Idle Planet Miner New Player Guide

Welcome to Idle Planet Miner (IPM)!  
This game is more than you expected.  
If you have experience with MMOs or MBAs,  
you will recognize the structure of this game.  
It is a skill-tree maximization meta game.  
You can play it fast, and you can play it slow.  
Some times you have to play it slow.  
Some times you have to play it fast.  
The top players have been playing for many years.  
They don't remember how to play the beginning  
"levels", but using their wisdom and my early  
experience, you won't have to guess.

Warning: Spoilers ahead. Idle Planet Miner is  
about learning the optimal growth of a skill-tree  
through repetition. If you follow this guide,  
you won't have to "play" through your first  
20-30 Galactic Sales, you'll just know what to do.

All of this information and so much more is available  
at the IPM discord. You can get an invite from the  
game settings page, check it out!

The first section describes the basics of Idle  
Planet Manager. Skip ahead to the second section,  
beginner walkthrough, if you want instructions on  
an optimized approach to mining the first 20 planets.

# Section 1: What is Idle Planet Miner

The following sections present the core ideas behind  
IPM. In order you will know the most important game  
elements down to, in my opinion only, the least  
important ones.

# Selling Your Galaxy  
"Rebooting" starts you over from day 1, but you  
keep managers, stars, credits, DM, rover  
missions, and beacon points. Your game will run  
faster after each reboot, sometimes much faster  
and sometimes not.

# Dark Matter (DM)  
Used for purchasing Brilliant Academy Managers and  
Slots for them.

# Ships  
All for-purchase ships will speed up gameplay only.  
They are all essential.

# Galaxy Value (GV)  
In your settings click "Show Galaxy Value". Your  
GV, plus the Exodus Ship, plus your Lounge  
Mothership room, determines the number of credits  
you get when you reboot.

# Credits  
Credits are used over many reboots. They purchase  
and upgrade Mothership Rooms, which are the main  
way of progressing through the game's timeline.

# Managers  
Each manager has a primary boost, a secondary boost,  
and a level. You must purchase Slots for your  
managers using DM. Each Slot allows you to assign  
a manager to a planet. You must also purchase  
managers using DM. Only purchase 500 DM managers  
from Briliant Academy. You will receive one  
Ark Public School manager per week for free  
as a daily reward.

A manager can be promoted to the next level by  
combining three other managers of the same level  
into it. The other three managers are lost.  
Managers with three stars and above have a  
secondary boost.

There are three primary boosts: Mining rate, ship  
speed, and cargo. Assign a mining rate manager to  
a planet to increase the production of ore on that  
planet. Assign a speed or cargo manager to a planet  
to get extra ore off of the planet if it has  
accumulated.

There are five secondary boosts: All mining rate,  
all ship speed, all cargo, craft speed, and smelt  
speed. Every secondary boost is good. Smelt and  
craft are the best, but won't contribute to your  
game until you have many slots.

In general, four managers of a specific level are  
better than one manager of one-level-higher. Only  
promote managers if you have more managers than  
you have slots. Don't have more slots than you  
have managers.

The best manager is mine/mine. Maximizing mining  
output is the fundamental objective of IPM. There  
will be a long period in your game when maximizing  
Crafting is the highest priority. mine/craft is  
the best during this period.

# Stars

When you complete challenges, tournaments, and  
some rover missions you receive stars. Each star  
is randomly assigned to one ore, alloy, or item,  
and increases its value by 20%. You do not control  
stars in any way, but as you accumulate them  
your game speed increases.

Credits + Managers + Stars = Your Level

# Mothership Rooms

There are many mothership rooms that will not be  
discussed in detail in this guide. Read about them  
[here](https://idle-planet-miner.fandom.com/wiki/Rooms).  
Credits are used to purchase mothership rooms. All  
mothership rooms are valuable, and you should purchase  
new ones as the price of upgrading the ones you have  
increases. The most important early-game mothership  
rooms are Engineering and Lounge. As your mothership  
room levels increase, your game progress will increase.

# Planets

Planets produce ore. They must be unlocked as projects,  
then purchased using $. The first 20 planets will be  
discussed in reasonable detail in  
[Section 2](# Section 2: First 20 planets Walkthrough)

# Ore

Each level of planets provides one or more new ore types.  
Each ore is worth double the previous ore. Planet basic  
upgrade costs increase with the cost of the ores that  
they produce, but usually your highest planets and highest  
ores will produce, by far, the most $.

The more individual ores per second that your galaxy  
produces, the larger your asteroid and debris awards will  
be.

You will occasionally tap on your mothership to sell  
ore for $ which you will use to upgrade your planets.  
Move the sell slider to about 90% and sell your ore  
once or twice. Always leave 3k+ ore of all types for  
your Smelter to use.

[TODO img of slider]

Ore can be set to auto-sell in the Mothership screen.  
Only do this until you have purchased the first four  
planets or have enough Copper and Iron income to  
complete the first two projects.

# Smelting

Ore is converted to Alloy via Smelting. The third  
project you will unlock is Smelting, which enables this.  
In [Section 2](# Section 2: First 20 planets Walkthrough)  
you will read about the order of smelting to perform  
to quickly progress through the early planets.

# Alloy

Every ore can be combined in various numbers to create an  
Alloy. The alloy is typically worth 2x the value of the  
ores that were used to produce it.

There are only three circumstances when you should sell  
Alloys. The first is when you receive a large asteroid  
bonus. Don't sell all of them, but always leave at least  
500+ to use in future crafting projects. The second time  
is in your first few Galaxies, if you have been idle for  
a long time, and have many more of an alloy than you will  
likely use. You can recycle these Alloys for $ to use to  
upgrade your planets. The last circumstance is if an  
Alloy has a very good Market and you are able to produce  
many of them to sell before the Market expires.  Do not  
ever sell Alloy outside of these rules: the time it takes  
to produce it is always more valuable than the $.

# Crafting

Alloy combines with Items to produce other items in  
the Crafting panel. The earliest items only require  
Alloy to produce, and later items require a combination  
of Alloy and Items, or only other Items.

Crafting requires the most substantial portion of time  
in IPM. In the beginning, your games will be long  
because you will always be waiting for your Crafter  
to finish.

In [Section 2](# Section 2: First 20 planets Walkthrough)  
I will provide build orders for Alloys and Items that  
will progress you through the Items that are required  
to complete all projects up to Planet 20 and a little  
beyond.

# Items

Items are simply another level of Alloy. They are used  
primarily for completing projects to upgrade your Galaxy  
or gain new abilities. A detailed discussion of Items  
that you need to progress in the early levels is in  
[Section 2](# Section 2: First 20 planets Walkthrough).  
The only time you should sell Items is if you have very  
good market for a specific item and can produce many of  
them. Otherwise they should be saved for projects.

# Asteroid Miner

The first project you will unlock is Asteroid Miner. This  
causes an asteroid to appear every 6 minutes. Tapping the  
asteroid, you will find an amount of a random Ore or Alloy  
that you have unlocked. This can make your Galaxy, as a  
large amount of a specific Alloy can save you much Smelting.

# Ark Bonus

On the same time frame, a yellow play button will appear  
every six minutes. The ark has a 50% chance of giving you  
5 DM or a cash bonus. The ark gives you the greater of  
4.75% cash on hand or 2.295% of GV.  The crossover   
happens when your cash-on-hand is about 48% of your GV.

Continuously Arking will increase your GV by 27% per hour,  
ignoring all other inputs. This is the fastest way to  
advance.

At this point I will note that your Galaxy produces ore  
at a much slower rate when IPM is not in the foreground  
of your device. Estimates say that your Ore/$ production  
is only 22% in the background than in the foreground.  
Crafting and Smelting occur at full speed, but mining does  
not. IPM intends for you to leave it running all the time.

# Debris Scanner

Debris harvesting is identical to Asteroid Miner, except  
that it produces Items instead of Ores and Alloys. The  
Debris Scanner project is pretty expensive and is a  
mid-game development and will not be covered in this guide.  
I have 38 reboots and have never come close to it.

# Rover

Rover produces DM, Stars, and Boosts.

# Boosts

Boosts are DM-purchasable items that speed up your game.  
In general, you don't need to save them. Use them during  
any long-run to get you farther than you've been before.

## Boost Stacking

The most important feature of Boosts is that Planet Boost  
and Production Boost stack with Time Warp. Use a Time Warp  
while Planet Boost or Production Boost is active to  
receive the Boost benefit for an entire hour in the  
background.

# Market

Market changes randomly and can slightly modify your progress.  
Later game projects make the Market slightly more predictable.  
In the early game, you can build Alloys or Items that have  
a high market value and experience consierable time savings.

Similarly, a poor market can slow you down.

# Colonization

Colonization appears as an option very early in your project  
development. Using Colonization in the early game is a very  
bad idea.

Colonization allows you to massively increase the production  
of the lowest level planets. Don't spend anything on Colonization  
until you have completed the following walkthrough. Colonization  
tasks are useful to increase your overall mine rate, which improves  
pink asteroid value, but they are very expensive in all of the  
minor items that you will need to get to planet 20.

# Section 2: First 20 planets Walkthrough  

1.1 Buy No Ads:

ARKing (pressing the ad button) is a core mechanic of IPM.  
Per of clicking the ARK button your galaxy will grow by 16% value and  
you will gain 60 DM. If you keep more than 50% of your Galaxy Value  
(GV) in cash $, then your GV will grow by 33% per hour or Arking. This  
in the late game is the fastest mechanism of advancement. In the early  
game, mining is the fastest, the mid game, crafting is the fastest,  
and in the late game only ARKing can really show progress.  

1.2 Click Settings -> Show Galaxy Value  

Galaxy Value (GV) is the primary currency in Idle Planet Miner. Enable  
it's constant display in the Settings menu.  

1.3 Like any other clicker game, click on anything the game tells you to.  

Follow the tutorials. Collect cash and DM by clicking icons with red dots  
on them.

1.4 Buy planets and upgrade them.

In order to advance, buy planets and upgrade them. Most planets perform  
best when all three purchase levels are the same: mine rate, ship speed,  
and cargo capacity. Increasing mine rate often feels like a superior  
strategy but unless you can get the ore off planet, it does not help  
GV. When you have extra cargo and speed managers, they can help you  
offload planets that mine more than they can return to the mothership.  

1.5 10M - sell  

When you reach 10_000_000 GV, sell your galaxy to purchase your first  
two mothership rooms: Smelt speed, ship speed, or cargo capacity. Each  
time you reach 10M for the first three playthroughs, sell your galaxy  
and buy more mothership rooms.

1.6 Make money. Do not auto sell.  

You will begin to build up ore on your mothership. Once per hour, play  
the game and sell 70% of your ore for money to upgrade your existing  
planets.

1.7 Market optimize when you can.

The Market button shows you which ores and items are most valuable. If  
you have time, increase the mine rate and production rate of items with  
increased market value to maximize your galaxy value during this time.  
Remember to sell the items and ore before the market expires or you  
won't keep the GV increase.

1.8 Mining in IPM is throttled when the app is not in the foreground.
